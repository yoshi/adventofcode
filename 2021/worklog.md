# Advent of Code 2021

## Day 06

Well, that was interesting.  My naive solution required all the memory and time, but using the hash solution was robust and super trivial.  Sometimes you have to bend your head to get a good approach.

## Day 05

Damn, doing this at night really gets me tired.  I think I will have to give up the ghost at some point and just do these in the morning.

## Day 02

Using the sample input to verify the results in advance of runs with the full data is a great way to ensure that your logic is sound.  In this case, I was kind of tired and didn't think too much before just laying stuff out for part b.  Using the sample data let me quickly understand the issues.  Still pretty easy stuff.

## Day 01 - Getting Started

I've decided to just use perl this year and to fill out with other languages as I feel the urge.

The first set of problems were quite simple, as is typical.  I want my code to be straight forward and easy to read regardless of the language at hand, so there may be revisions for just formatting after problem completion.

I'm considering a possibility to minimize the use of memory by not mapping files into arrays.  That would make for some heavy lifting in file manipulation, but it sounds like fun.  Lets see where Day 02 goes and I'll decide then.

# Advent of Code 2021

## Day 01 - Getting Started

I've decided to just use perl this year and to fill out with other languages as I feel the urge.

The first set of problems were quite simple, as is typical.  I want my code to be straight forward and easy to read regardless of the language at hand, so there may be revisions for just formatting after problem completion.

I'm considering a possibility to minimize the use of memory by not mapping files into arrays.  That would make for some heavy lifting in file manipulation, but it sounds like fun.  Lets see where Day 02 goes and I'll decide then.

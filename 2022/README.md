## Log
### Day 03
I'm getting suspicious.  This was too easy.

### Day 02
I'm super tired so I couldn't think past brute force.  I hope to
revisit this one with a more interesting solution.

### Day 01
Getting back to the grind!

Executed using perl just to get it done since i'm tired.  Will add
more languages as time permits.

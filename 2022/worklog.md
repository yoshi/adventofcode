# Advent of Code 2022

## Day 01

Getting back to the grind!

Executed using perl just to get it done since i'm tired.  Will add
more languages as time permits.

## Day 02

I'm super tired so I couldn't think past brute force.  I hope to
revisit this one with a more interesting solution.

## Day 03

I'm getting suspicious.  This was too easy.

## Log
### 2024-11-13T09:15 Day 0 Boilerplate
I'm thinking that spending a bit of effort to create a baseline for fundamental structure would be good for all languages that I start with.

I created a data set called 00.dat that I expect every language to open, print, and perhaps do some other manipulations on that data.

### 2024-11-12T19:45 Preparation
I'm considering what programming languages I'll use for this year.  I think that my best bet would be to just do the things in perl and then if I feel fancy, pick up another programming language to mess around with.

Here are the potential alternative languages:
* Gleam - Seems like a nice language that sits on top of the Erlang VM
* Common Lisp - Cuz why not
* Go - I'm already pretty ok with this.  It is just slow.
* Julia - It has been a long time since I've poked at it.  It was super fun.
* Zig - I really like this language.
* Odin - I know nothing about this.
